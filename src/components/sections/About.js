        I am an enthusiastic and innovative developer with expertise in building
        web and mobile applications. With a strong foundation in the MERN stack,
        Java, and C++, I have worked on a diverse range of projects, including
        game development, hospital management systems, and e-commerce platforms.
        My skills in React, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and mobile app development
        enable me to create dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly solutions.
