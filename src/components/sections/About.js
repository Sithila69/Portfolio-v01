    <p>
      I am an enthusiastic and innovative developer with expertise in building
      web and mobile applications. With a strong foundation in the MERN stack,
      Java, and C++, I have worked on a diverse range of projects, including
      game development, hospital management systems, and e-commerce platforms.
      My skills in React, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and mobile app development
      enable me to create dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly solutions.
